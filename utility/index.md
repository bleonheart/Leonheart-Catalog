The catalog is divided into five categories:

- [**General Mechanics**](): A diverse array of mechanics, ranging from passive to active ones. This category includes various features designed to help run a server and keep it active.

- [**Talkable NPCs**](): Submodules tied to a framework of talkable NPCs, offering alternative dialogue and optional voice line outputs.

- [**Management**](): Management modules aimed at assisting admins with tasks, including NPC spawns, daily rewards, and other minor management features.

- [**HUDs/UIs**](): Various user interfaces designed to enhance the visual appeal of your game mode.

- [**Compatibility**](): Various modules to implement compatibility with non-Lilia native content.
